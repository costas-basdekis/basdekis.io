## First blog post

Welcome to my blog! I decided it was high time I would start subjecting a
wider audience to my ramblings, and programming opinions! Through this blog,
I'll try to present to the world my exploration in software development, and
hopefuly I touch a subject worthy of discussion and reading.

I will write mostly about learning, exploring, and opinion-giving on programming
and software development. I'll write about my projects, my impressions of things
I learn about, and my precious views.

So sit tight, and check back often.
